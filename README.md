# CarPrice_Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts car prices based on various features using linear regression. The project follows the complete machine learning pipeline from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Aim : Using a data set from kaggle to focus on data processing and comparing the results given by different algorithms - a multivariate linear regression written from scratch, a linear regression model from sklearn package and a random forest regressor

The main goal of this project is i) to learn about processing data before using any model ii) implement a multivariate linear regression model from scratch iii) use a pre-written linear regression model and a Random Forest Regressor model from sklearn package to compare the results

Data Set Used was derived from Kaggle's Housing Price Regulation contest
